# Purpose of this R Package

## This R Package is a Project Template

### What I Want to Accomplish

1.  Automate setup of the file and folder directory for every new project
2.  Standardize folder directories across projects
3.  Standardize `.rproj` preferences across projects
4.  Standardize R Studio global settings across projects
    1.  Set Code Appearance preferences:
        1.  Options:
            1.  Dark or Light mode
            2.  Highlight Function Calls
            3.  Rainbow Parentheses
            4.  ...more options
    2.  Set Rmarkdown preferences
        1.  Standardize `knitr` setup chunks in every new Rmd document
        2.  Standardize display of Markdown documents
            1.  Show document outline by default
                1.  Also show all code chunks (named and unnamed)
        3. Setup pandoc and pdflatex options
5. Probably more things that I will add...
